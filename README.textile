h1. Orlando Code Kata Challenge #1 - Codebreaker Marker

This is my erlang implementation.

h2. To run tests:
1. You will need to have erlang installed
1. Run `erl` in this directory
2. At the prompt, run `c(codebreaker).` to compile the code
3. Then run `codebreaker:test().`

h2. To run method itself:
2. Run `erl` in this directory
3. At the prompt, run `c(codebreaker).` to compile the code
4. Then run something like `codebreaker:mark([r,y,g,b], [c,c,c,c])` where [r,y,g,b] is the secret and [c,c,c,c] is the guess
