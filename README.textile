h1. Orlando Code Kata Challenge #1 - Codebreaker Marker

This is my erlang implementation.

h2. To run tests:
# You will need to have erlang installed
# Run `erl` in this directory
# At the prompt, run `c(codebreaker).` to compile the code
# Then run `codebreaker:test().`

h2. To run method itself:
# Run `erl` in this directory
# At the prompt, run `c(codebreaker).` to compile the code
# Then run something like `codebreaker:mark([r,y,g,b], [c,c,c,c])` where [r,y,g,b] is the secret and [c,c,c,c] is the guess
